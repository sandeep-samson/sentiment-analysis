# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

**Project Overview**
-------------------

This project utilizes the BERT model for sequence classification tasks. It loads a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tunes it on a downstream task using the `BertForSequenceClassification` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

**Model Architecture**
---------------------

The model architecture consists of:

*   BERT: A pre-trained language representation model that takes in input sequences and outputs contextualized token embeddings.
*   Classification Head: A linear layer on top of BERT's output to predict the final classification label.

**Required Python libraries**
-----------------------------
The required Python libraries for this project are:

*   **Transformers**: This library provides pre-trained models like BERT, as well as tools for fine-tuning and evaluating these models. You can install it using pip: `pip install transformers`
*   **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**: These deep learning frameworks are used to load and run the pre-trained BERT model. The code snippet uses PyTorch, but TensorFlow could also be used.
*   **Numpy**: This library is used for numerical computations in Python.

Additionally, you may need other libraries depending on your specific requirements, such as:

*   **Pandas** or **NumPy** for data manipulation and loading
*   **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation and selection
*   **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** for visualization

**Code Snippet Explanation**
-----------------------------

The code snippet provided shows the loading and evaluation of the pre-trained BERT model:

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    'bert-base-uncased',
    num_labels=len(label_dict),
    output_attentions=False,
    output_hidden_states=False
)

# Move the model to a device (e.g., GPU)
model.to(device)

# Evaluate the model on a validation set
```

**Usage**
---------

To use this project, you will need:

*   A pre-trained BERT model checkpoint (`bert-base-uncased`)
*   A downstream dataset for fine-tuning
*   A label dictionary mapping labels to IDs

The code snippet provides an example of how to load the pre-trained BERT model and fine-tune it on a downstream task using the `BertForSequenceClassification` class.

**Future Work**
-----------------

To improve this project, consider the following:

*   Experiment with different pre-trained models and fine-tuning objectives
*   Investigate techniques for handling out-of-vocabulary tokens and rare labels
*   Explore ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models
